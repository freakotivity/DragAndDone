A daily Routines App for You with Adult ADD
The hallmark traits of ADD/ADHD — inattention and distractibility —
make organisation perhaps the biggest challenge adults with the disorder face.
If you have adult ADD/ADHD, the prospect of getting organised, whether it be
at work or home, may leave you feeling overwhelmed. However, you can learn to
break tasks down into smaller steps and follow a systematic approach to organisation. [1]

Cognitive learning and training methods like neurofeedback and working memory training
are non-invasive methods which during the recent years experienced a growing interest
and empirical support for improving ADD/ADHD symptoms. [2]

Focus on Five recurring Tasks
- create a daily, weekly, or monthly folder
- define your desired three to five tasks
- set an icon or take a picture for each task
- choose a reminder alarm if you want to

Drag and Done
Drag your achieved task to the done area. You keep track of the tasks that have been
accomplished. Great! Now you stay motivated, stick to your routines and make them neat
habits!
